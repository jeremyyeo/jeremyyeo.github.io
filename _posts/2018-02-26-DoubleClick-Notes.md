---

DoubleClick Digital Marketing includes multiple ad products to help you manage every aspect of your digital advertising. Each product is a robust tool on its own, but when two or more products are combined each becomes more powerful.

* **DoubleClick Ad Exchange** is a real-time advertiser and publisher marketplace. Advertisers can purchase ad inventory the moment it becomes available, using open and direct bidding-based auctions.
* **DoubleClick Bid Manager** is DoubleClick's demand-side platform, giving advertisers the tools and controls they need to buy impressions through real-time bidding and programmatic direct buys across multiple exchanges. 
* **DoubleClick Campaign Manager** is DoubleClick's third-party ad server. Agencies and advertisers use Campaign Manager to traffic media plans, upload creatives, and set ad serving rules. 
* **DoubleClick Creative Solutions** simplifies ad creation and management to help brands and creative agencies get digital ads out the door faster and better, using tools like Google Web Designer and DoubleClick Studio.
* **DoubleClick Search** makes it faster and easier to manage large campaigns across search engines. Robust reporting and bid optimization help advertisers get more value from search.

DoubleClick Campaign Manager
----------------------------

1. Create advertiser

    Create a parent advertiser and some child advertisers if you want to see results separately. To assign an avertiser as the parent, go to the child advertisers "Floodlight configuration" tab, click on "Share advertiser" and select another advertiser as the parent. This set-up allows performance comparisons of the separate business units while still retaining a holistic view of performance at the parent advertiser level.

2. Create campaign

    Create a new campaign by selecting a "Campaign name" and selecting an advertiser. Also set the schedule for the campaign as well as the "Landing pages".

3. Create placement

    For the campaign created above, create placements which determine where ads will run. Select sites to assign placement and set compatability required (e.g. Display) and dimensions required (e.g. 300 x 250) which will match the placements available on the selected site.

4. Upload creatives

    3 types of creatives are available:
    * display (images and animated gifs)
    * rich media (interactive ads)
    * in-stream video
    
    For the campaign above, click "NEW" and choose the type of creative (e.g. Display). Give the creative a unique name, include the creative dimensions so you can quickly identify them (e.g. Car 300 x 250). Next go to "Creative assets" section and 'Add asset..." which will prompt to upload creatives. Once creative uploaded, Campaign Manager will automatically update the "Dimensions" field. Click 'Save' to finalize.

5. Create ads

    This unites the placement with the creative. For each ad, you want to assign "creatives" and "placements" to it, including the 'Default Web Ad'.

6. Download and send placement tags

    Now you need to send the placement tags to the publisher (site that you've chosen to advertise on). Check that every component of your campaign is set to "Active". Go to tags to download them. Select the line item of the desired placement you want to export (available in Excel, Text and HTML formats). After reviewing the file, email it to the publisher. 

If you are a DoubleClick Bid Manager user, there is no need to send tags. Simply create the placement under the Site ID that is synced to Bid Manager.
